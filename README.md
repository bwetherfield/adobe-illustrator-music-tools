# adobe-illustrator-music-tools
Scripts, symbol/brush libraries, and information for setting up Adobe Illustrator for composing freely. 
Tested on 2014 and 2015 iterations of Adobe Illustrator CC. The scripts work specifically on mac computers
because they are wrapped up in applescript. But you could extract the quoted javascript and perhaps
add some VB and make them work on Windows. Is Linux even supported by Adobe? Doubt it.

Initially developed for Mauricio Pauly and later my own composition work.
