# adobe-illustrator-music-tools
Scripts, symbol/brush libraries, and information for setting up Adobe Illustrator for composing freely. 
Tested on 2014 and 2015 iterations of Adobe Illustrator CC. The scripts work specifically on mac computers
because they are wrapped up in applescript.

Initially developed for Mauricio Pauly and later my own composition work.

Go to Documentation.txt for set-up next steps. Go to Design.txt for musings.
