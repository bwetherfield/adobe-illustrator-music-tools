UsageTip

On the mac, I can press command+spacebar and start typing the abbreviation at the
start of each app/script name. That way activating the relevant script is pretty instant
even when Illustrator is running.

Alternatively, have the scripts open in a finder window while you are working in Illustrator
and double click when needed.
