Note on permission issues:

If you try to run the scripts in this folder without altering permissions, they may not
run. If a pop-up comes up  (on attempted execution) that says one of these .app files does
not have "assistive access", you will need to navigate to System Preferences -> Security & 
Privacy, select Privacy and Accessibility and select the appropriate checkbox. If problems
persist, consider using scripts in the No Permission Needed folder of this package.
