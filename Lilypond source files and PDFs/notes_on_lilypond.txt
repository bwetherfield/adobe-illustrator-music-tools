The majority of the attached .ly files are Lilypond files that extract symbols in
tabulated form from the font-table include (included). They use non-standard Lilypond
markup syntax specific to tables. For an example of usual Lilypond markup, see 
UsedInDevelopmentPhase->ExtraMusicNotation.ly . Standard Lilypond markup proved
insufficient for isolating all of the Feta Font (Lilypond music) symbols in the
development phase, but was useful for finding non-symbol objects such as hairpins
(crescendi, diminuendi etc.) - this was the use of 
UsedInDevelopmentPhase->ExtraMusicNotation.ly .
