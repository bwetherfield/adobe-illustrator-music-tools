NOTE ON "MULTIARROWTOOL" PLUGIN:

This tool has been edited to produce musical "hairpin" symbols (crescendo, diminuendo, 
flared crescendo and flared diminuendo) instead of arrows. The hand tool symbol on the
tools panel of Adobe Illustrator will still display the original icons (an arrow or a
line depending on which tool is selected), but each handle will produce one of the
hairpin symbols respectively.

NB: although source files have been included, they will probably not be buildable
unless the full Adobe Illustrator CC SDK (with includes) is installed. To add the
plugin to Adobe Illustrator, follow the instructions in the top level “documentation.txt"
file included with this package. It will require Xcode 4.5.2 to be built because of 
compatibility issues.



Additional feature:
Select any hairpin that has been placed using the tool and run Niente in the Default
Actions of the Actions Panel of Illustrator (provided that the Default_Actions.aia 
file in Add to Illustrator/Default Page, Brushes has been added to your copy of 
Illustrator in line with the Instructions.txt in the same folder. The Action will 
add a “niente” circle to the point/ tip of the hairpin, which is conventionally used
to indicate that a sound comes from or goes to nothing. See ExtraMusicNotation.pdf
in folder: Lilypond source files and PDFs/UsedInDevelopmentPhase for examples.
The design of the hairpins has been closely modeled on Lilypond examples.
