SET UP INSTRUCTIONS FOR DEFAULT PAGE SET UP, including "Stafflines" BRUSH:

copy the following into Terminal and press enter:
defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles YES

(or some equivalent to reach hidden folders in Finder)
(to undo, just input
defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles NO
)

Alt+Right Click Finder 
	in the doc and select relaunch

Now navigate to 
~/Library/Application Support/Adobe/Adobe Illustrator 18/en_US/
	New Document Profiles
	
And overwrite Print.ai with the Print.ai file included in this package. The only
difference with the default is that it contains "Stafflines" in the brush library,
which is necessary for the makeStave.app script (see scripts).


ALTERNATIVELY (1):
Each time you have a new musical document in Adobe Illustrator, select
Window->Brush Libraries->Other Library... and choose StafflinesBrushLibrary.ai
(included herein), then simply click the "Stafflines" brush (it looks like
five parallel lines, and its name appears if you hover above it with the 
mouse)


OR (2): you can add "Stafflines" to Print.ai in a similar way, and save and quit.


SET UP INSTRUCTIONS FOR DEFAULT ACTIONS, including "Outline Stroke" and "Scale":
Overwrite Default_Actions.aia in <Adobe Illustrator>/Presets/en_US/Default_Actions.aia.
The four additional (simple) Actions are triggered optionally in some versions
of some of the scripts included with this package (see Scripts for details).
