These libraries are more precisely sized than the original set (now found in Old Feta).

I have made a script that creates a 65% stave. I may update it. Need to check whether the lines should be thinner in a smaller stave/ related questions.

At the time of writing, ../Default\ Page,\ Brushes/print.ai may need to be updated to
reflect these changesâ€¦
