# About
This plugin has been adapted to produce musical "hairpin" symbols (crescendo, diminuendo,
flared crescendo, flared diminuendo) instead of arrows.

# Alternatively
You may prefer the approach of drawing a line in illustrator and changing the brush to one of the
hairpin brushes in the brush library included with this package.
