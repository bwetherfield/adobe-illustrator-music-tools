For this: Adobe Illustrator Music Notation Add-ons package
Copyright Ben Wetherfield 2014

This is the first port of call for getting to grips with this Adobe Illustrator add-on
package.

Adobe Illustrator or Illustrator will always refer to Adobe Illustrator CC 2014, the 
free trial of which can be downloaded from the Adobe website.

A NOTE ABOUT COMPATIBILITY: .scpt and .app files in the Scripts folder will only run
on Mac operating systems. They use the AppleScript language, which is not compatible
with Windows. .jsx files run on both (and other) operating systems. AppleScript 
functionality could ultimately be translated to VBscript for use on Windows.

What purpose does this package serve?
Non-conventional music notation calls for more design capability and more flexibility
than most music notation software packages allow. In itself, however, Illustrator is
quite a blank slate, and does not provide many features that lend themselves directly
to music notation. This package provides a means of setting up the user for writing
music agilely using Illustrator.

Included:
A handtool-style plug-in for drawing hairpins (crescendi, diminuendi etc.)
A small set of defaults to reinstall into Illustrator to make other features run
	more smoothly
A set of scripts that interact directly with Illustrator (for musically useful
	outcomes!)
	
More information about the features and how to use them is included (in .txt files) in
the relevant folders that house each feature as part of this package.

Where next?
Read the .txt files found in the Add to Illustrator folder for information on how to
update Illustrator for the purposes of this package and using Illustrator for musical
notation. Start with the Default Pages, Brushes subfolder, then move to the Tool Plug-in
subfolder.

Head to the Scripts folder next for more music notation functionality. Read the .txt file
for details.

Peruse source files and music notation PDFs in the other two folders to taste.
